- **Multilingual Support**: Write, generate, or speak content in English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, and Malayalam.
- **Rich Text Editor**: Full WYSIWYG Tiptap editor featuring advanced formatting (Undo/Redo history, Tables, Text Colors, Lists) for manual writing context.

### ⚡ **Performance & Architecture**
